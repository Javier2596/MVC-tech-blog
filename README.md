## Usage

The application once complete is to allow users to blog post about their perspectives on topics about code, technologies, concepts, etc. The features would also allow users to comment on other user's blog post that would help bring discussion for the topics. Possibly in the future the application can have a 'like' and 'share' feature for the blog post,
